# Restaurant Page

This is a single-page restaurant home page that I created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Webpack.

## Features

- **Single-page** No need to load more pages, everything works on a single page
- **Modular food menu** Any amount of foods can easily be added to the menu in the source code, and the site will adapt

## Check it out!
